\name{create_s3_directory}
\alias{create_s3_directory}
\title{Create an "S3 directory" placeholder}
\usage{
create_s3_directory(bucket_name, directory_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{bucket_name}{Character scalar. S3 bucket name.}

\item{directory_name}{Character scalar. Prefix to create. A trailing `/` is
added if missing.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `TRUE` if a placeholder object was created, `FALSE`
  if the prefix already had objects.
}
\description{
S3 does not have real directories; prefixes ending in `/` are treated like
folders by many tools. This function checks whether any objects already exist
under a prefix and, if not, creates a zero-byte placeholder object at that
prefix.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
create_s3_directory("my-bucket", "some/prefix")
create_s3_directory("my-bucket", "some/prefix/")  # equivalent
}

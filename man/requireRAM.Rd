\title{Block Execution Until Available RAM Exceeds Threshold}
\usage{
requireRAM(threshold = 4000, unit = "MB", wait_time = 10, max_attempts = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{Numeric. Minimum amount of free memory required (default 4000).}

\item{unit}{Character. Unit for memory threshold (e.g., "MB" or "GB").}

\item{wait_time}{Numeric. Seconds to wait between consecutive checks (default 10).}

\item{max_attempts}{Integer. Maximum number of check attempts before giving up (default 10).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} once the available RAM meets or exceeds the threshold.
}
\description{
\code{requireRAM} pauses execution in a loop until the system reports at least
the specified amount of free RAM. Useful for long-running data-intensive tasks
that require guaranteed memory availability before proceeding.
}
\details{
This function relies on \code{check_ram()} to query system memory.
It will repeatedly sleep for \code{wait_time} seconds and retry until
the available RAM is sufficient or the maximum number of attempts is reached.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Wait for at least 4 GB free memory before starting heavy computation
requireRAM(threshold = 4000, unit = "MB", wait_time = 10, max_attempts = 20)
}
}
